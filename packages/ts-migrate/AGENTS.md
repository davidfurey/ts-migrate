# ts-migrate agent playbook

Instructions for AI coding agents driving the ts-migrate CLI to migrate a
JavaScript project to TypeScript. Print the copy matching your installed
version with `npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate agents`. Human-oriented
docs live in this package's README.md.

## Critical facts

1. **The package is scoped.** A bare `npx ts-migrate ...` downloads the
   unmaintained upstream `ts-migrate` package (TypeScript 4 era) instead of
   this fork. Either install `@obiemunoz/ts-migrate` as a devDependency first,
   or pass `-p` on every npx call:
   `npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate full <folder>`.
   `ts-migrate --version` (or `-v`) prints the installed version; the upstream
   CLI has no version flag and errors, so this is a quick check for which
   package npx fetched.
2. **`ts-migrate full` prompts before starting.** Pass `--yes` to skip the
   prompts. Without `--yes` and without stdin, the run exits nonzero before
   doing anything. There is no separate `ts-migrate-full` bin; it was removed
   once the pipeline became a command, and `ts-migrate full <folder>` takes the
   same arguments it did.
3. **`ts-migrate full` creates git commits** after each step by default. Pass
   `--commit=false` to leave every change in the working tree instead — do this
   when you manage commits yourself or the target is not a git repository.
   Commit or stash the target folder first either way. The run reports what is
   uncommitted there and then renames and rewrites those files, and with
   commits enabled `git add .` also puts them in the migration's commits.
   Under `--yes` that report is a warning and the run continues.
4. **Suppressions in the output are success, not failure.** The tool's
   contract is that `tsc` compiles with zero errors afterwards; it fulfills it
   by annotating what it can prove and suppressing the rest with
   `@ts-expect-error` comments and `any`. Do not try to hand-fix every
   suppression; follow the workflow below to eliminate the bulk of them.
5. **Gitignored files are skipped by default.** Build output inside the
   source tree (bundles, `dist`, coverage) is neither renamed, migrated,
   type-checked, nor counted; `init` also writes the gitignored directories
   into the generated tsconfig's `exclude`. Runs log what they skipped. If a
   migration seems to miss files, check whether git ignores them; pass
   `--gitignore=false` to include them deliberately.
6. **Build system files stay JavaScript by default.** Configs and scripts
   that must keep running under plain Node (`webpack.config.js`,
   `eslint.config.mjs`, paths run via `node scripts/build.js`, and the
   files they require) are kept out of rename so the build still boots;
   `init` writes them into the generated tsconfig's `exclude`. Detection
   covers every extension the compiler reads as JavaScript: `.js`, `.jsx`,
   `.cjs`, `.mjs`, and a config split per environment
   (`webpack.config.production.js`) counts as a config the same way
   `webpack.config.js` does. Runs log every kept file with its evidence. Pass
   `--bootstrap=false` to rename them anyway, e.g. when the project loads
   TypeScript configs through ts-node or tsx. In `migrate` and `reignore`
   the flag only decides whether those files are loaded into the program;
   nothing there edits JavaScript.
7. **Requirements:** Node >= 22.18. TypeScript >= 5.7.3 and < 7 if the target
   project has TypeScript installed; if it has none, ts-migrate falls back to
   its own bundled compiler and plain JS projects work out of the box. The
   Node floor is about the machine running ts-migrate, not the project being
   migrated: this is a codemod, and nothing it writes depends on the Node it
   ran under.
8. **The migration runs the project's own compiler.** `migrate`, `reignore`,
   `retype` and `check` load the `node_modules/typescript` found by searching
   from `<folder>` upward, not the one npx resolved for ts-migrate, because
   every suppression written is derived from what that compiler reports. The
   first line of a run names the copy in use, for example
   `TypeScript 5.7.3 (project: /repo/node_modules/typescript)`. A project with
   no typescript, or one outside `>=5.7.3 <7`, falls back to the bundled
   compiler with a warning. Pass `--typescript <path>` (the package directory
   or any file inside it) to name a compiler that is not under
   `node_modules`, or to force a specific one; `ts-migrate full` applies it to
   the migrate step and the final compile check alike. Any compiler a minor or
   more away from the project's own install is warned about, at the start of
   the run and again at the end: the checker changes in every minor release,
   so the suppressions written are not the set the project's `tsc` reports.
   Patch differences are quiet.
9. **The eslint-fix step runs the project's own ESLint**, the
   `node_modules/eslint` found by searching from `<folder>` upward, because
   the project's config was written for that engine: a rule using the ESLint 8
   context API (`context.getScope()` and friends, removed in 9) throws under a
   newer engine, and those files come back with no lint fixes. The step prints
   the copy in use once, for example
   `[eslint-fix] ESLint 8.57.1 (project: /repo/node_modules/eslint)`. A project
   with no eslint, one below 8.0, or a flat config with an eslint below 8.57
   falls back to the ESLint bundled with ts-migrate. Pass `--projectEslint=false`
   to `migrate` or `reignore` to use the bundled one regardless.
10. **The ESLint config is resolved from `<folder>`, not the working
    directory**, so `ts-migrate migrate packages/app` from a repository root
    picks up `packages/app`'s own config and falls back to one above it. A
    config that sits above the working directory but not above `<folder>` is
    another project's and is not used; that run goes to the eslintrc engine.
    The config file is printed next to the engine line, for example
    `[eslint-fix] flat config: /repo/packages/app/eslint.config.js`. If that
    line names no file, or names one you did not expect, the lint pass is
    running against the wrong rules. A project with no ESLint config at all
    gets no lint fixes, and eslint-fix says so once per pass. `ts-migrate full`
    reports the same thing `ts-migrate migrate` does here: it writes no config
    of its own for the migrate step to find.
11. **Flags are camelCase**, matching `tsc` and `tsconfig.json`: `--dryRun`,
    `--inferTypes`, `--maxStablePasses`, `--jsonSummary`. That is the one
    spelling `--help` prints, so write flags that way. The dashed spelling of
    any flag parses too, so an older script passing `--dry-run` still works and
    does not need changing.
12. **A `ts-migrate.config.json` supplies flags**, so a long invocation does
    not have to be reconstructed each run. It is looked for in `<folder>` and
    then upward, or named with `--config <path>`; the run prints the file it
    read. Flags on the command line override it. Keys are flag names, top
    level keys apply to every command that takes them, and a section named
    after a command applies to that one. See the section below.

## Configuration file

```json
{
  // Flag names as keys. JSON5, so comments and a trailing comma are allowed.
  "sources": "app/**/*",
  "maxStablePasses": 3,
  "migrate": { "plugin": "jsdoc" },
}
```

- Found in `<folder>` and then in each directory above it, first one wins.
  `--config <path>` names one directly and skips the search.
- Read by `full`, `rename`, `migrate`, `reignore`, `retype`, `report` and
  `check`. `init`, `init:extended` and `agents` take no flags.
- Precedence is command line, then the command's section, then the shared
  keys. `--gitignore=false` overrides `"gitignore": true` in the file.
- A shared key the running command has no flag for is ignored, so one file
  serves every command: `"inferTypes": false` configures `migrate` and is
  ignored by `rename`. A key no command takes fails the run naming the file
  and the key, as a mistyped flag on the command line does.
- A repeatable flag takes an array: `"excludePlugin": ["eslint-fix"]`. A path
  resolves against the working directory, as it does on the command line, not
  against the config file. A key is a flag's long name, not its short alias:
  `"sources"`, never `"s"`.
- Do not write a config file into a project you are migrating unless asked.
  Pass the flags, or write the file somewhere outside the tree and point
  `--config` at it.

## Recommended workflow (full migration)

```sh
# 0. Preflight — from the target project's root:
#    - working tree clean, on a fresh branch
#    - dependencies installed (npm install / pnpm install / yarn install)
#    - environment types installed FIRST; this typically prevents the
#      majority of suppressions (require, process, describe, it, ...):
npm i -D @types/node          # plus your test runner's types:
                              # jest -> @types/jest, mocha -> @types/mocha,
                              # vitest -> add "vitest/globals" to tsconfig "types"
                              # and your bundler's, on a browser app:
                              # webpack -> @types/webpack-env
                              # vite -> nothing, init pins "vite/client"
#    Skipping this is not fatal: whichever of init and migrate runs first
#    names what is still missing, before the migration turns those errors
#    into suppressions.

# 1. Migrate. <folder> is the project (or sub-project) root, the directory
#    where tsconfig.json belongs.
npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate full <folder> --yes --commit=false

# 2. Read the "Type definition recommendations" report printed at the end of
#    the run. Install what it recommends, e.g.:
npm i -D @types/jest
#    If the generated tsconfig pins a "types" array (it does whenever @types
#    packages were installed at init time), also add the new package there,
#    e.g. "jest" — the report says so when it applies.

# 3. Re-run reignore: it strips every suppression the new types resolve and
#    prints an updated recommendations report. If step 1 was scoped with
#    --sources, repeat the same flags here. Add --casts to also retry the
#    `as any` assertions the migration inserted, dropping the ones that have
#    gone stale and narrowing the rest; it is slower.
npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate reignore <folder>

# 4. Verify:
npx tsc -p <folder>/tsconfig.json --noEmit   # must exit 0

# 5. Reduce the debt: retype is step 3 with the any annotations retried too.
#    Every one records a type the checker could not work out on migration day,
#    and the annotation is what keeps it that way, since inference only fires
#    where a declaration carries no type. It strips each one, asks the engine
#    again, and keeps only what the file re-checks clean with a type that is no
#    longer any; the rest are restored byte for byte. It ends with what it took
#    off the debt. Same flags as reignore, so repeat any --sources from step 1.
#    It does step 3's work as well, so it can replace step 3 rather than follow
#    it; it is the slower of the two.
npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate retype <folder>
npx tsc -p <folder>/tsconfig.json --noEmit   # must exit 0 again
```

Steps 2, 3 and 5 are the loop: whenever the project's types move on — a new
`@types` package, a neighboring directory migrated, a CommonJS module
converted — running them again recovers what has since become knowable.
`ts-migrate report` and `ts-migrate check` are how you tell whether a pass
through the loop was worth it.

A run may also add `types/ts-migrate-modules.d.ts`, declaring the imported
packages that ship no type definitions. Commit it: without it those imports
are errors again. Delete a line from it once that package has real types
(a later run drops the entry on its own), and never add hand-written
declarations to it — ts-migrate rewrites the file.

Every declaration file a run generates is TypeScript only, so a lint config
that parses it as JavaScript reports `Parsing error` on it. The run says so at
the end (`This project's ESLint cannot parse 1 generated declaration file`) and
names each file with ESLint's own message. `tsc` is unaffected, and the
generated file cannot fix it: a parse error is fatal, so no `eslint-disable`
comment in the file suppresses one. Fix the project's ESLint config instead,
either by extending the entry that sets the TypeScript parser to cover the
generated paths or by adding them to that config's `ignores`. Either one
silences the warning.

On a webpack project, `init` also writes `types/ts-migrate-assets.d.ts`,
declaring the asset imports the bundler resolves and TypeScript does not
(`import logo from './logo.png'`, `import './App.css'`). Commit it too.
Only the extensions the project imports are declared, and only where the
loader cannot change the type: images, fonts and media get a `string`
default export, and an extension imported only for its side effects gets a
module with no exports. An extension imported by name, a style sheet bound
to a name (CSS modules), and `*.svg` in a project that has an svgr package
installed are all left undeclared, because only the loader knows what those
export and a wrong declaration type-checks while a suppression does not.
`init` names each one it skipped. Declare those yourself, in a file of your
own rather than in this one.

A run may also add `types/ts-migrate-globals.d.ts`, declaring the properties
the code hangs off `window`, `global` and `globalThis` so those reads and
writes type-check instead of taking a cast at each site. Commit it too. A
property the code only reads is declared too, since a global a third-party
script tag sets is never assigned anywhere in the project and a read of an
undeclared property is an error just the same. Its types are the ones the
assigned expressions state outright and the any alias everywhere else, so
narrowing one to the real shape is the useful edit and a later run keeps it.
The report names the properties nothing assigns, which are the ones whose real
type can only come from whatever sets them outside the project. Delete an entry
once something else declares that property, since two declarations of one
global is an error. Do not add entries by hand: the file is rewritten from its
own declarations every run.

A generated declaration file only counts if the project's tsconfig matches it:
otherwise it is in the migration's own program and no later one, and every
error it resolved comes back on the next `tsc` run. A run that finds its
tsconfig does not match one adds the path to that config's `"include"`, or to
`"files"` when the config has no `"include"` of its own (appending to an
inherited one would replace the base's list, and `"exclude"` does not filter
`"files"`). The run says which key it edited. Review that edit with the rest of
the diff.

Afterwards, update the project plumbing the tool deliberately does not touch:

- Add a way to produce/run JS again: a `tsc` build step or a TS-aware runner
  (tsx, ts-node). Point the entry point fields the rename listed (`main`,
  `bin`, `exports`, and friends) at output that exists. Script paths and test
  globs were repointed for you; see `ts-migrate rename` below.
- Teach ESLint about TypeScript (`@typescript-eslint` parser + plugin).
- If the run created commits, consider a repo-root `.git-blame-ignore-revs`
  so blame skips the mechanical rewrites; the run's final checklist prints
  the SHAs and the caveats per merge workflow (see `--blameIgnoreRevs`).

`full` asks for the first two only where it finds no sign of them, so the
checklist a run prints holds what that project has left rather than the
whole list above. A build step is any script that invokes a compiler or a
TS-aware runner (`tsc -b`, `tsx`, `node -r ts-node/register`, `vite`,
`next`), or a declared dependency that is one, including what teaches a
JavaScript toolchain to read `.ts` (`ts-loader`,
`@babel/preset-typescript`); `tsc --noEmit` alone is a type check and does
not count. ESLint counts as taught when a config or a dependency names
`typescript-eslint`, or a shared config that brings it. Both look at the
folder's own `package.json` and every one above it up to the repository
root, so a monorepo's shared toolchain answers for its packages. Neither
can tell whether a build actually emits, so both err towards asking.

## Commands

### `ts-migrate full <folder> [flags]`

Runs the whole pipeline: init tsconfig → rename JS/JSX to TS/TSX → migrate →
verify with `tsc --noEmit`. Each step is the command of the same name, run in
one process against one compiler, so the pipeline reports exactly what running
the four commands by hand reports.

Before Step 1 it names a `<folder>` that is not in a git repository once and
then runs without commits, and reports anything uncommitted in `<folder>`.

A `<folder>` that does not exist exits `255`, as it does from every other
command. A failing step names itself, prints the type definition
recommendations gathered so far along with the file holding them, and exits
with that step's exit code; the partial result stays in the working tree.

- `--yes` (`-y`): skip the interactive prompts (accept defaults).
- `--commit=false`: do not create git commits after each step. Commits are on by
  default (`--commit` is the explicit form).
- `--blameIgnoreRevs`: append the SHAs of the commits this run creates to a
  `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file at the repository root so `git blame` can
  skip the mechanical rewrites. Only useful on merge-commit workflows; with
  squash or rebase merges those SHAs never reach the main branch, so leave
  the flag off and add the merged commit's SHA to the file after the merge
  instead. A successful run prints the SHAs and this guidance either way;
  the flag is ignored with `--commit=false`.
- `--version` (`-v`): print the ts-migrate version and exit.
- `--config <path>`: take flags from `<path>` instead of the
  `ts-migrate.config.json` searched for from `<folder>` upward. Flags passed
  here override it either way.
- `--typescript <path>`: run the migrate step and the final `tsc --noEmit`
  check with the compiler at `<path>`. Without it, both use whatever compiler
  the migrate step resolved (the project's own, when it has one). The
  interactive prompt for a custom tsc path is the only way the two steps end up
  on different compilers; a mismatch there stops the run before Step 1 rather
  than at the check. `--yes` sets no custom path, so it never applies.
- `--dryRun`: preview without writing anything. Steps 1 and 2 report the
  tsconfig they would create and the full old-to-new rename mapping; the run
  then stops, because Steps 3 and 4 read the files the rename would have
  written and a dry run wrote none of them. Preview the migration itself with
  `ts-migrate migrate <folder> --dryRun` once the rename has really happened.
  Nothing is committed under `--dryRun`, whatever `--commit` says.
- `--jsonSummary <file>`: write a JSON summary of the whole run (see
  "Machine-readable summaries" below). This is the summary to read from a
  script: it carries each step's status and commit SHA plus the rename and
  migrate summaries, rather than one step's summary overwriting another's.
- All other flags are forwarded to the underlying `rename` and `migrate`
  commands (e.g. `--sources`, `--inferTypes=false`, `--excludePlugin`,
  `--projectEslint=false`, which is also repeated in the reignore hint printed
  on failure). `ts-migrate full --help` lists every one of them, and a flag
  none of them declares exits `1` rather than being ignored.
  One `--sources` deliberately reaches both the rename and the migrate step: a
  scoped migration needs the same subset renamed and then migrated, so passing
  it once is what makes the two agree. `--typesReportFile` and
  `--suppressionReportFile` are likewise deliberate here even though only the
  migrate step acts on them, since a full run is otherwise the one path that
  cannot produce either file.
- `--plugin` is **not** accepted here, only on `ts-migrate migrate`. It runs a
  single plugin instead of the pipeline, which leaves the errors the rest of the
  pipeline would have resolved, so Step 4's `tsc --noEmit` check would fail by
  construction. `--excludePlugin` is the flag for a staged migration.

### `ts-migrate init <folder>` / `ts-migrate init:extended <folder>`

Writes a migration-friendly `tsconfig.json` in `<folder>` (no-op if one
exists). `resolveJsonModule` is on, so JSON imports type as their contents
instead of collecting a suppression each. `allowJs` is on (and `checkJs`
off), so a migration done one directory at a time resolves imports into the
directories it has not converted yet instead of suppressing each one; those
files are read for their types and never migrated in place.
The module settings follow the project: `commonjs`, or `nodenext` when
package.json declares `"type": "module"`, or `esnext` with
`"moduleResolution": "bundler"` when the project builds with Vite or webpack
(either one in `dependencies`/`devDependencies`, `react-scripts` for a
Create React App project, or a `vite.config.*`/`webpack.config.*` file in
`<folder>`). Bundler projects need
that third setting because the bundler resolves their imports, not node:
`import.meta` is TS1343 under `commonjs`, and extensionless relative imports
are TS2835 under `nodenext`. A Vite
project also gets `"vite/client"` in the `types` array when vite is
installed, which is what declares `import.meta.env` and the asset imports
(`*.svg`, `*.css`). For a webpack project, install `@types/webpack-env` so
`require.context` and `module.hot` type; init says so when it is missing.
A webpack project also gets `types/ts-migrate-assets.d.ts`, described below.
A project whose modules are imported by name rather than by relative path
(`import App from 'shared/App'`) gets the `paths` that make those resolve,
read from its `jsconfig.json` when it has one and otherwise from
`resolve.modules`/`resolve.alias` in a root `webpack.config.*`. It is always
`paths` and never `baseUrl`, even when the source was a `baseUrl`, because
TypeScript 6 reports that option as deprecated (TS5101) and 7 drops it; a
`"*"` pattern does the same job on every supported compiler. The
webpack config is parsed, never executed, so only entries written as string
literals, `__dirname`, `path.join`/`path.resolve` or `const` bindings of
those are translated. An entry whose target is computed at build time, does
not exist on disk, sits outside `<folder>`, or is contradicted by a second
config is left out and named in the log, because a `paths` entry pointing at
the wrong directory type-checks while a suppression is visibly unfinished.
Read that log: an alias it names is one you may want to add by hand.
Before writing the config, init also names the type packages the project's
dependencies imply and does not have installed: `@types/node`, and the
`@types` for a declared test runner, with the install command for the
detected package manager. It is advice, not a gate: init writes the config
and exits 0 either way. It stays quiet in a project whose dependencies are
not installed, where every package would look missing, and about a package
package.json already declares. `migrate` and `reignore` print the same
thing with their opening banner, so a folder that already has a tsconfig
and never reaches `init` still gets it before the pipeline rather than
hours later (`--typesPreflight=false` turns it off; `ts-migrate full` passes
that flag to the migrate step whenever Step 1 already said it). Everything
else waits for the end of run report, which needs the compiler.
Installed `@types` packages are pinned in a `types` array so that
TypeScript 5 (which loads `node_modules/@types` automatically) and
TypeScript 6 (which does not) check the project identically; add new
`@types` packages to that array after installing them. Gitignored
directories and detected build system files present at init time land in
the config's `exclude` (together with TypeScript's defaults, which an
explicit `exclude` would otherwise replace) so the project's own `tsc`
skips build output and keeps the build's own files JavaScript.
`init:extended` writes a config extending a shared base instead.

### `ts-migrate rename <folder> [-s <glob>]`

Renames `.js`/`.jsx` to `.ts`/`.tsx` (JSX content detected per file), and
`.mjs`/`.cjs` to `.mts`/`.cts`. A `.mjs`/`.cjs` file keeps its extension
when a build tool loads it by name (`postcss.config.cjs`,
`eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc.cjs`) or when it holds JSX, which
`.mts`/`.cts` cannot; both cases are logged with the file and the reason.
Gitignored files are skipped (`--gitignore=false` renames them too). Build
system files are kept as JavaScript with a log line naming each file and
its evidence (`--bootstrap=false` renames them too; a tsconfig `exclude`
entry keeps a specific file out for good). `--dryRun` prints the full
old-to-new mapping (surfacing each `.ts` vs `.tsx` decision) and renames
nothing. `--jsonSummary <file>` writes the old and new path of every
renamed file as JSON (see "Machine-readable summaries" below).

The rename also repoints the package.json references that follow
mechanically from the mapping, in every package.json from the directory of
a renamed file up to `<folder>`: the paths and globs in `scripts`, in the
`jest` block (`testMatch`, `collectCoverageFrom`, `setupFiles`,
`setupFilesAfterEnv`, `globalSetup`, `globalTeardown`) and in the `mocha`
block (`spec`, `require`). Only references that resolve to a file in the
mapping change, so a build system file kept as JavaScript keeps its `.js`
path (`"build": "node scripts/build.js"` is left alone). A glob is
rewritten to the new extension only when nothing it matched is still
JavaScript; when unmigrated files still match, or the matches renamed to
both `.ts` and `.tsx`, it is widened into a brace group instead
(`**/*.test.js` becomes `**/*.test.{js,ts}`). Edits are text splices, so
the file's formatting and key order survive.

Entry points are reported, not rewritten. `main`, `module`, `browser`,
`bin`, `exports`, `types`, `typings`, and `files` address the package from
the outside, and after a TypeScript conversion they need to name build
output rather than the renamed source, which the rename cannot produce.
Every one that still names a renamed file is logged, and listed in the
JSON summary, for you to repoint once a build step exists. The log adds
"add a build step" to that notice only for a project that has none, on the
evidence `full`'s closing checklist uses. An entry point that names a build
system file is absent from both lists, because that file was never renamed:
`"start": "node src/cli.js"` keeps `src/cli.js` as JavaScript, so a `bin`
pointing at it stays valid and needs no notice.

### `ts-migrate migrate <folder> [flags]`

Runs the codemod pipeline on an already-renamed project: re-points imports
that name a file under an extension the project does not ship it under,
rewrites CommonJS `require`/`module.exports` into TypeScript
module syntax, declares the properties the code assigns to `window` and
`globalThis`, converts React propTypes to types, names the props of the
components that never had propTypes, writes the type arguments React hook
calls need, infers types from usage, declares the properties assigned onto
empty object literals, annotates remaining implicit `any`s,
widens the annotations the file's own assignments contradict, and suppresses
residual compiler errors with `@ts-expect-error` so the project compiles.
Only TypeScript files are
migration targets. `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` and `.cjs` are never edited, even
when a tsconfig with `allowJs` pulls them in; they stay in the program and
still type the files that import them. Run `rename` on a file to make it
migratable.

The import step covers two forms. `import foo from './foo.js'` after the
rename moved that file to `./foo.ts` is one: `tsc` resolves it by substituting
the extension and stays silent, while the bundler resolving the literal path
does not. `import foo from './foo.ts'` is the other, and it is error TS5097,
so the extension is stripped rather than left for ts-ignore to put an
`@ts-expect-error` on. Both drop the extension, or keep a `.js` one when the
importing file is ESM; a `./foo.mts` or `./foo.cts` import becomes
`./foo.mjs` or `./foo.cjs`, the extension it emits. An import whose target is
still on disk, one under `allowImportingTsExtensions`, and one whose base
names a second file are all left alone. Absolute imports the project maps
through tsconfig `paths` are covered too, so run `init` first if your aliases
live only in `webpack.config.js` or `jsconfig.json`.

The CommonJS step matters on vanilla Node projects: left alone, `require()`
returns `any` and every import boundary in the project loses its types. It
emits `import x = require('m')` and `export = x` by default, which compile to
the same CommonJS and need no `esModuleInterop`, and named exports where a
named import has to reach them (`const { a } = require('m')`,
`module.exports = { a, b }`, `exports.a = ...`). Named exports add the
non-enumerable `__esModule` marker to the emitted module, which only a consumer
default-importing the whole module object through Babel-style interop can
observe. A file that is already ESM gets `import x from 'm'` and
`export default`. Dynamic, conditional and non top level forms are left for
ts-ignore, and the run reports each file it left alone and why. Pass
`--excludePlugin convert-commonjs` to keep CommonJS syntax as it is.

The hook step covers `useState(null)`, `useState(undefined)`, `useState([])`,
`useState({})` and `useRef(null)`, whose initializers infer `null`,
`undefined`, `never[]` and `{}` and turn every later use into an error. It
only touches calls an existing error already blames, takes the arguments the
setter is called with (or, for a ref, the intrinsic tag it is attached to) as
the type, and writes it only when re-checking the file reports no new error.
A hook whose evidence leaves the file gets an `any` (`$TSFixMe`) type
argument, which is one visible any in place of the suppressions the call would
otherwise earn. The same step types `createContext()`, `createContext(null)`
and `createContext(undefined)` from a `<Ctx.Provider value={...}>` in the same
file, writing a union that keeps the default
(`createContext<Theme | null>(null)`) and supplying `undefined` as the
argument of the zero argument form, which a type argument alone leaves as
TS2554. A context provided from another file takes the any type argument
instead, since one file cannot see it, and `createContext({})` always does: a
`{}` default accepts every value, so narrowing it would break a caller the run
cannot see. Pass `--excludePlugin react-hook-types` to leave hook calls
as they are.

The `react-class-state` step declares the state type of a class component from
its initializers, `setState` calls, reads and direct writes.
A member no initializer sets stays optional unless an unconditional statement
in the constructor establishes it. Literals are typed from their syntax; other
values use the checker where its answer can be named in the file, adding
type-only imports where needed, and fall back to `any` (`$TSFixMe`) otherwise.

A component that spreads a rest element onto another element accepts that
element's props too, which propTypes never say: they describe what a component
reads, not what it passes on. The forwarding step widens such a component's
props to `Props & Omit<Partial<React.ComponentProps<typeof Icon>>, 'name'>`,
where the omitted keys are what the pattern binds for itself, so a prop the
component declares keeps its own type. Only a rest element spread onto a
single element counts, and the widening is written only when re-checking the
file with it in place reports no new error. Pass `--excludePlugin
react-forwarded-props` to leave those props types as the propTypes wrote them.

propTypes also say nothing about the props a component is simply given: a
component validates a subset of what its callers pass, and JSX in JavaScript
checks neither. The passed-props step reads the project's own JSX and declares
those props on the component's annotation, typed from what the call sites pass,
with `any` where nothing can be printed. A prop the type already declares is a
type mismatch rather than a missing member and is left alone, and each prop is
proven on its own against the declaring file. Pass `--excludePlugin
react-passed-props` to keep only the props propTypes mention.

The other side of the same gap is a prop the component reads. A prop that only
ever arrives through a spread, a wrapper or a container is checked against
nothing at the call site, so the props type has no member for it and every read
inside the component costs a suppression. The read step declares those props on
the component's annotation, typed from the value a call site passes for the prop,
the member of the object a call site spreads, the element the component spreads
it onto, or the parameter it is handed to. A prop whose type none of that proves
keeps its suppression: the tool does not invent `any` to clear a diagnostic, for
the reason below. A read TypeScript suggests a near-miss name for is left alone,
since a name one letter off a declared one is a typo rather than an undeclared
prop. Pass `--excludePlugin react-read-props` to leave those reads to the
suppression pass.

A suppression is a legitimate output, not a failure to be counted down. Where the
project proves nothing about a type, `@ts-expect-error` beats writing `any`, on
two mechanical grounds rather than taste. It withdraws itself: the day something
declares the member, the directive becomes `TS2578` and has to be removed, so the
debt cleans itself up, and `reignore` re-evaluates the whole set on a later run.
And it is local, where a declaration is a contract: adding `subtitle?: any` to a
props type silences the excess-property error every call site passing `subtitle`
reports today, and licenses every future one. A read under a suppression is
already error-typed, so the suppression gives up no checking at the read that the
`any` would have kept. Prefer it wherever a pass would otherwise declare
something it cannot prove.

The widening step unions an annotation with what the assignments in its own
file give it, so `let x: number` later assigned null ends up `number | null`
instead of `@ts-expect-error`. It only ever writes a type it can name in that
file without a new import, never touches parameter annotations, and caps how
wide an annotation may get, leaving anything else for the suppression pass.
Each widening is re-checked in isolation and dropped unless the errors it was
made for are gone and no new one appeared. A widened declaration other files
can see (an exported interface member, a property of an exported class) tells
them what it really holds, which can surface errors in those files on the same
run. Pass `--excludePlugin widen-annotations` to keep annotations as written.

JavaScript has no arity checking, so a parameter callers leave off was already
optional before the migration; the declaration is what makes it required, and
every such call then costs a suppression. The arity step marks those `?`, from
the position the fewest arguments any call in the project passes, and only
where re-checking the declaring file reports no new error. A call the arity
error was hiding an argument mismatch behind reports that mismatch once the
arity is right, so a few suppressions change code rather than going away. Pass
`--excludePlugin optional-parameters` to leave every parameter required.

An object type written inline on a parameter is inferred from one function
body, which is a guess about callers that live in other files, and every
disagreement costs a suppression at the call site. The shape step reads the
project's own calls and relaxes it to what they support: a member no argument
carries becomes optional, a member whose type they contradict becomes `any`,
and a shape whose last required member the calls refute is dropped for `any`,
since a type of nothing but optional members rejects an argument sharing no
property with it and would only trade one error for another. A relaxation the
declaring file gains a new error from is dropped. Pass `--excludePlugin
relax-parameter-shapes` to keep those shapes as they were inferred.

- `--sources <glob>` (`-s`, repeatable): migrate only a subset. Quote globs.
  Ambient `.d.ts` files matched by the tsconfig `include` (vite-env.d.ts,
  custom globals) are kept in the program automatically; pass
  `--ambientSources=false` to disable that. The rare package that ships
  unimported globals outside `@types` still needs a manual re-include,
  e.g. `-s "node_modules/some-package/globals.d.ts"`.
- `--gitignore=false`: also migrate gitignored files. By default they are kept
  out of the program entirely (neither parsed nor edited; files imported by
  migrated code and the tsconfig's `.d.ts` files stay in for type
  resolution).
- `--bootstrap=false`: also load build system files into the program. By
  default they are kept out of it entirely. They stay JavaScript either
  way; only `rename` converts them.
- `--inferTypes=false`: skip type inference and annotate plain `any`. Much
  faster; use on very large projects or when annotation quality is secondary.
- `--maxStablePasses <n>` (default 5): cap the repeat passes of the
  inference stage.
- `--jsdoc=false`: skip the JSDoc conversion. By default the pipeline reads the
  types the comments document, so a `@param {number}` becomes `: number`
  instead of falling back to `any`, `@type` annotates variables and class
  properties, `@typedef` and `@callback` become type aliases, and `@template`
  becomes type parameters. A `@type` written on a parenthesized expression,
  `/** @type {T} */ (expr)`, is a cast the checker reads only while the file
  is JavaScript, so it becomes `(expr as T)` rather than going silent on
  rename. It is a no-op on files with no JSDoc tags.
- `--annotateReturns`: also take return types from `@returns`. Off by
  default, and not implied by the JSDoc conversion above: a return type is
  inferred from the body and recomputed on every build, so a stale `@returns`
  replaces a better signal, while a stale `@param` still beats `any`. Turn it
  on for projects whose comments are known to be maintained.
- `--typeMap <json>`: map JSDoc type names to TypeScript types, e.g.
  `--typeMap '{"Object":"any"}'`. Merged over the defaults, which already
  map `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `date`, `array` and `promise`.
- `--plugin <name>`: run a single plugin instead of the pipeline. Takes one
  name; repeating the flag is an error, since the subtractive case is
  `--excludePlugin`. The plugin gets the same options it would get in the
  pipeline, so plugin flags such as `--defaultAccessibility` apply here too.
  A flag the named plugin has no option for is reported and ignored.
- `--excludePlugin <name>` (repeatable): run the default pipeline without the
  named plugin; every occurrence is removed (`eslint-fix` runs twice). Unknown
  names error and list the valid ones. For a staged migration that surfaces
  residual errors for manual fixing instead of suppressing them, pass
  `--excludePlugin ts-ignore --excludePlugin strip-ts-ignore`; pass
  `--excludePlugin eslint-fix` to keep lint-autofix churn out of the diff.
  Excluding `infer-types` is equivalent to `--inferTypes=false`.
- `--modernizeDefaultProps=false`: keep `Component.defaultProps = { ... }` on
  function components and type it, instead of moving the defaults into the
  props destructuring (`{ size = 'md' }`), making those props optional and
  deleting the assignment. React 19 ignores defaultProps on function
  components, so the conversion is on by default. It is made only where it
  cannot change behavior: literal default values, an object literal in the
  same file, nothing else reading the defaults or `Component.defaultProps`, a
  destructured props parameter that binds every defaulted prop, and a props
  type declared in full in that file. Everything else, class components
  included, keeps the assignment, marked in place (see below).
- `--aliases tsfixme`: use `$TSFixMe`/`$TSFixMeFunction` instead of plain
  `any`. If the project does not already declare those globals, the migration
  writes them to `ts-migrate-aliases.d.ts` in `<folder>` so the output still
  compiles.
- `--defaultAccessibility private|protected|public`: give every class member
  that declares no accessibility modifier this one. Off by default, so members
  keep the implicit `public`.
- `--privateRegex <regex>`, `--protectedRegex <regex>`, `--publicRegex <regex>`:
  give class members whose name matches the regex that modifier instead of
  `--defaultAccessibility`. The first match in that order wins, so
  `--privateRegex "^_"` marks underscore-prefixed members private and leaves
  the rest alone. All four flags feed the `member-accessibility` plugin, which
  runs in the default pipeline and under `--plugin member-accessibility`.
- `--declareUntypedModules=false`: suppress every import of a package that ships
  no type definitions, instead of declaring those packages once in
  `types/ts-migrate-modules.d.ts`. By default the run generates that file
  (only for packages the compiler reported as untyped), so those imports stay
  checkable imports typed `any` rather than N `@ts-expect-error` comments.
  Entries are kept across runs and dropped once their types resolve, so
  installing a real `@types` package retires one. A file at that path that
  ts-migrate did not write is never touched. Kept in the project's tsconfig on
  the same terms as `--declareGlobals=false` below.
- `--declareGlobals=false`: cast every read and write of a property the code hangs
  off `window`, `global` or `globalThis`, instead of declaring those properties
  once in `types/ts-migrate-globals.d.ts`. By default the run generates that
  file and prints what it declared. A property the code only reads is declared
  too: a global a third-party script tag sets is assigned nowhere in the
  project, and reading an undeclared property is an error just the same. Types
  are the ones the assigned expressions state outright and the any alias
  everywhere else, so narrowing one by hand is the useful edit and a later run
  keeps it. A read never contributes a type, only the property, so a property
  the assignments typed keeps that type however often it is read. Entries are
  never dropped automatically: delete one once something else declares that
  property, since two declarations of one global is an error. A property whose
  name is a reserved word keeps its cast when it is used through `global` or
  `globalThis`, since no `var` can be declared with that name. A file at that
  path that ts-migrate did not write is never touched. The run keeps the file
  in the project's tsconfig, editing `"include"` or `"files"` when it has to;
  without a tsconfig it can read, it casts at each site instead, since a
  declaration file nothing includes would leave the project failing `tsc`.
- `--addMissingImports=false`: suppress every name a file uses but never brings
  in, instead of importing it. By default the run asks TypeScript for the same
  import its quick fix menu offers and applies it, so the helpers and components
  a bundler used to inject become real imports rather than a
  `@ts-expect-error TS(2304)` per use site. This matters beyond the comment
  count: a suppressed name is `any`, so every pass that reads types afterwards
  infers from the `any` instead of the real type. Names no module in the
  program exports are untouched and still get the comment.
- `--ambiguousImports first|skip`: what to do with a name TypeScript offers from
  more than one module. `first` (the default, and what "Add all missing imports"
  does in an editor) takes the module TypeScript ranks first, marks the import
  with the modules it passed over (see the follow-up markers below), and reports
  the count; `skip` leaves those names alone, so they keep the suppression
  comment and a person picks. A module and a barrel that re-exports it count as
  one candidate, not two, so this only fires where the name genuinely has two
  homes.
- `--dryRun`: run every plugin pass but write nothing to disk. Prints each
  file a real run would update, with the suppression and `any` counts it
  would then contain. The report matches a real run exactly (with
  `--aliases`, the declaration file is modeled in memory), and the run takes
  as long as a real one. Diffs are not printed; run for real on a clean git
  tree and use `git diff`.
- `--jsonSummary <file>`: write a JSON summary of the run to `<file>`: the
  changed files, per-plugin change counts, and the suppression and `any`
  counts in the changed files (see "Machine-readable summaries" below).
- `--suppressionReportFile <file>`: write what the compiler knew about every
  diagnostic the run suppressed to `<file>` (see "Suppression report" below).
- `--typescript <path>`: run with the compiler at `<path>` instead of the one
  found by searching from `<folder>` upward (critical fact 8).
- `--projectEslint=false`: run eslint-fix with the ESLint bundled with ts-migrate
  instead of the project's own (critical fact 9).
- `--typesPreflight=false`: start the pipeline without naming the type packages
  the project declares dependencies for but has not installed. On by default,
  printed with the opening banner, and never a reason for a nonzero exit.

### `ts-migrate reignore <folder> [flags]`

For an already-TypeScript project that stopped compiling (dependency
upgrades, new types) or right after installing `@types` packages: strips all
existing suppression comments, then re-adds only the ones still needed.

- `--sources <glob>` (`-s`, repeatable): reignore only a subset. On a repo
  migrated one directory at a time, pass the same globs as the scoped
  migrate so files outside the subset are left untouched. Ambient `.d.ts`
  files from the tsconfig are kept automatically here too
  (`--ambientSources=false` disables).
- `-p`/`--messagePrefix`: customizes the comment text.
- `--casts`: also retry the `as any` assertions ts-migrate inserted. Each one
  is dropped, the file is re-checked, and the removal is kept only where no
  error appears that the file did not already have. An assertion the file
  still needs is then retyped to the tightest type the checker can name for
  it, either the operand's own type without its null or the type the position
  expects, and that is kept only where the re-checked file gains no error and
  the expression is no longer `any`. A type that would need a new import, an
  anonymous shape, a generic needing type arguments and a union past four
  members are all refused, and those sites keep their `any`. Assertions to any
  other type are left alone. Off by default: it costs up to two validation
  passes per file holding one. On by default in `retype`, which is where this
  belongs on a project whose types have moved on: run it after installing
  `@types` packages or after a neighboring directory has been migrated, and read
  the reduction off `ts-migrate report`/`check`.
- `--gitignore=false`: same behavior as in `migrate`.
- `--bootstrap=false`: same behavior as in `migrate`.
- `--declareUntypedModules=false`: same behavior as in `migrate`.
- `--addMissingImports=false`, `--ambiguousImports first|skip`: same behavior as
  in `migrate`. This is the retroactive path for a project migrated before the
  import pass existed: the suppressions come off, the `Cannot find name` errors
  are reported again, and the names a module in the program exports become real
  imports instead of the comments going back on.
- `--dryRun`: same preview behavior as `migrate`.
- `--jsonSummary <file>`: same machine-readable summary as `migrate`.
- `--typescript <path>`: same compiler override as `migrate`. A scoped
  migration reignored later must use the same compiler, or the suppressions
  will not match.
- `--projectEslint=false`: same lint engine override as `migrate`.
- `--suppressionReportFile <file>`: same suppression report as `migrate`.
- `--typesPreflight=false`: same behavior as in `migrate`. Worth leaving on
  here: the reason to run `reignore` is usually that `@types` packages were
  just installed, and the preflight names the ones that were missed before
  the pass rather than after it.

Both `migrate` and `reignore` end the run by printing a one-paragraph type
debt summary (the `report` totals for the project).

### `ts-migrate retype <folder> [flags]`

`reignore` with the `any` annotations retried, for a project whose types have
moved on since it was migrated: `@types` packages installed, a neighboring
directory migrated, CommonJS modules converted to ESM. Each annotation is
stripped, TypeScript's inference engine is asked again, and the result is kept
only where the re-checked file gains no error it did not already have and the
checker answers something other than `any` for the declaration. Everything else
is restored byte for byte, so the diff holds only the types it recovered.

- Takes every flag `reignore` takes, with the same meanings. Repeat the
  `--sources` globs of a scoped migration here too.
- `--casts` is on by default here (off in `reignore`): a stale `as any` is the
  same debt as a stale annotation. Pass `--casts=false` for the annotations
  alone, which is the faster run.
- In scope: `any`, `any[]`, and an alias the project declares as `any`
  (`$TSFixMe`). A hand-written annotation is left alone, and so is an alias for
  a function type (`$TSFixMeFunction`), which would pass the "not `any` any
  more" test whether anything improved or not. Interface and type-literal
  members are left alone as well: nothing infers those.
- Three kinds of replacement are refused even where they check clean, and those
  sites keep their `any`: a type that says nothing a reader can use (`null`,
  `undefined`, `void`, `never`, and arrays of those, which is what the engine
  prints where the only evidence was an argument nothing was passed for); one
  over 120 characters or spanning lines, since the engine will print a
  parameter's whole structural shape with the comments from the source type
  included; and one holding more `any` than the annotation it replaces, e.g.
  `callback: any` for `callback: (arg0: any, arg1: any) => any`, which
  `ts-migrate check` would read as debt growth and fail a build over.
- A class property whose type the constructor assignment establishes loses its
  annotation rather than gaining a printed one, which is the same bare
  declaration declare-missing-class-properties writes. TypeScript gives it the
  same type either way.
- A replacement that names a type the file does not import brings the import
  with it, added to the file's import of that module where there is one. The
  `any` it replaces is often the reason nothing imported the type, so these are
  the annotations a run recovers most of; before, they failed the re-check and
  the site kept its `any`.
- The suppression comments are rewritten with reignore's `FIXME` prefix, so a
  project migrated by `migrate` (which writes none) sees a one-word change on
  every one of them. Pass `-p ''` to keep them as `migrate` wrote them.
- The run ends with what it took off the debt rather than with the totals:

```
Type debt change for frontend/foo:
  @ts-expect-error comments: 40 -> 41 (+1)
  @ts-ignore comments: 0 -> 0 (0)
  any-alias annotations: 120 -> 96 (-24)
  explicit any annotations: 8 -> 8 (0)
  Total: 168 -> 145 (-23)
```

A suppression count that goes up is the expected shape of the trade. Validation
is per file, so an annotation narrowed to what its body needs is a type a caller
in another file can now be wrong about; the suppression pass runs after the
retry for that reason, and the project still compiles. Run `tsc --noEmit`
afterwards as you would after `reignore`.

### Values imported as types

`TS1361` ("'x' cannot be used as a value because it was imported using
'import type'") is repaired rather than suppressed: ts-ignore drops the `type`
modifier, so `import type { connect }` followed by a `connect(...)` call
becomes a value import again. Suppressing it would be worse than the error,
because a type-only import is erased when TypeScript emits and the value is
undefined at run time. A name with no value to import is `TS2693` instead, and
is still suppressed.

The `import type` comes from the project's own lint config, which `eslint-fix`
runs during the migration (`@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports`
rewrites a value import as type-only when it cannot see a value use), so it can
happen again on any run and the repair runs after it. A project migrated before
this landed still holds these suppressions: find them with
`grep -rn "TS(1361)"` and clear them with `ts-migrate reignore <folder>`.

### Follow-up markers

Four plugins recognize something they cannot convert and leave it for a person:
react-default-props (a function component's `defaultProps`, which React 19
ignores), jsdoc (a `@type` cast, a `@template` on an unnamed class, a
`@typedef`/`@callback` that stays a comment), convert-commonjs (exports it
cannot rewrite), and ts-ignore (a diagnostic inside a multiline string,
template, or comment, which cannot take a suppression). Each writes a comment
at the site:

```
// TODO(ts-migrate): React 19 ignores defaultProps on function components. Convert to
// destructured parameter defaults by hand.
// Left defaultProps in place: a default value is not a literal.
Chip.defaultProps = { tone: TONE };
```

So `grep -rn "TODO(ts-migrate)"` is the worklist after a run, and it stays
accurate as the markers are deleted. Re-running does not stack them: a site
already carrying one is left alone and still reported. The end of the run
prints the counts per plugin with no file names, since the files hold the list,
and `--jsonSummary` records the same grouping under `pluginNotices`. A cause
with nowhere to write a marker is reported with `"marked": false` and the run
leaves the `grep` line off.

### Suppression report

A suppression comment keeps the error code and 50 characters of the message.
Everything else the compiler knew is gone the moment the comment is written:
`getSemanticDiagnostics` does not report a diagnostic a directive already
suppressed, so no later command can recover it. `migrate` and `reignore` read
that evidence just before it is hidden and end the run with a grouped count of
what was suppressed and which fix each group needs. Pass
`--suppressionReportFile <file>` to also write the per-diagnostic detail:

- the full message through `flattenDiagnosticMessageText`, with every link of
  the elaboration chain and its own error code;
- the `relatedInformation` entries with their source locations, which name the
  missing argument or the declaration the type came from;
- per code, the checker evidence the message does not carry: the resolved
  signature and the callee's declaration site for `TS2554`, the parameter type
  against the argument type plus the missing and mismatched properties for
  `TS2345` and `TS2322`, both member declarations for `TS2416` and `TS2425`,
  and the paths the compiler tried for an unresolved `TS2307` module.

Type strings in the report are never abbreviated.

One entry is written per diagnostic, but ts-ignore writes at most one comment
per line. Where a line held more than one diagnostic, only the first reaches a
comment, so the per-code totals `ts-migrate report` scrapes match the report's
"commented" column, not its "diagnostics" column. The report states how many
diagnostics that covers.

### Type names that resolve to nothing

The jsdoc plugin writes what the comments document, and a comment can name a
type the code never declares: `@param {ASTNode} node` becomes `node: ASTNode`
whether or not `ASTNode` exists. Those annotations reach ts-ignore as `TS2304`
and would otherwise be one anonymous suppression per site.

Both `migrate` and `reignore` end with those names grouped, one line per name
rather than one per site, since every site of a name shares the single edit that
would fix it. Each line carries the count, the number of files, how many sites a
JSDoc tag documents, and where the program declares the name:

- a name declared somewhere the reference cannot see, in the project or in a
  dependency, is a missing import or a missing qualifier, and the report names
  the declaration file and line;
- a name nothing declares is a stale comment, or a type parameter no
  `@template` declares, and the report says nothing declares it.

The log names the five largest and counts the rest;
`--suppressionReportFile <file>` lists every name with the files that wrote it.

### `ts-migrate report <folder> [--json]`

Measures the type debt left in the project: `@ts-expect-error`/`@ts-ignore`
comments (with the suppressed error codes ts-migrate embeds in them),
any-alias annotations (`$TSFixMe` and friends, discovered from the aliases
the project's `.d.ts` files declare rather than hardcoded), and explicit
`any` annotations. Prints totals plus the 10 worst files and how many more
have debt. Counts come from per-file ASTs. A suppression counts where
TypeScript acts on it: the directive has to open its comment line, in any
comment form (`//`, `///`, `/* */`, `/** */`, `{/* */}`). A directive inside
a string, a template literal, or JSX text is not counted, and neither is a
mention of one in prose. Gitignored files are not counted
(`--gitignore=false` counts them; same flag on `check`). `--json` prints the
same data as JSON, with every file listed.

### `ts-migrate check <folder> [--updateBaseline]`

Enforcement mode of the same scanner, meant for CI. The first run writes a
per-file baseline to `.ts-migrate-baseline.json` in `<folder>`; commit that
file. Later runs exit nonzero if any per-file count exceeds the baseline,
and lower the baseline automatically when counts improve. After an
intentional increase, accept the new counts with `--updateBaseline`.
`--baselineFile <path>` overrides the baseline location. Versions before
0.17.0 missed hand-written `/** @ts-ignore */` suppressions, so the first
run after upgrading can fail on debt that was always there;
`--updateBaseline` accepts it.

### `ts-migrate agents`

Prints this document.

## Machine-readable summaries (`--jsonSummary`)

`full`, `rename`, `migrate`, `reignore`, and `retype` accept `--jsonSummary
<file>` and
write a JSON summary of the run there; stdout stays human-oriented. Common
fields:
`command`, `tsMigrateVersion`, `rootDir`, `exitCode`, `dryRun`. Paths in the
summary are relative to `<folder>`. When `dryRun` is true the summary
describes what a real run would have changed (nothing was written except the
summary file itself); combining `--dryRun` with `--jsonSummary` is the
machine-readable preview. Per command:

- `rename`: `renamedFiles` as `{"from": "src/a.js", "to": "src/a.ts"}` pairs,
  `packageJsonRewrites` (the script paths and test globs it repointed, as
  `{"file", "key", "from", "to"}`), and `packageJsonNotices` (the entry point
  fields that still name a renamed file and were left for a build step, as
  `{"file", "key", "value", "target"}`).
- `migrate`, `reignore` and `retype`: `filesToMigrate` (how many files the
  plugins were handed, counted before the first one ran; `0` means the run
  touched nothing whatever the rest of the summary says),
  `changedFiles` (every file the run modified),
  `generatedFiles` (declaration files the run wrote itself, e.g.
  `types/ts-migrate-modules.d.ts` and `types/ts-migrate-globals.d.ts`, which
  are new files rather than edits),
  `generatedFileParseErrors` (the generated declarations the project's ESLint
  reports a parse error on, as `{"file", "message"}`; those leave `eslint .`
  failing after a run that exits 0, and the fix belongs in the lint config, not
  in the file),
  `migratedFilesWithSyntaxErrors` (migrated files that still do not parse),
  `nonMigratedFilesWithSyntaxErrors` (files that will keep failing `tsc` and
  that re-running cannot fix), `plugins` (`{"name", "changedFileCount"}` per
  pipeline step, in order), `pluginFailures` (files a plugin could not
  process, grouped by cause, as `{"plugin", "reason", "ruleId", "fileCount",
  "files"}`; empty when every plugin processed every file), `pluginNotices`
  (work a plugin recognized and left for a person, grouped the same way, as
  `{"plugin", "reason", "hint", "ruleId", "marked", "fileCount", "files"}`;
  `marked` means every site also carries a `TODO(ts-migrate)` comment, so the
  entry restates what the files already say), `pluginErrors`
  (one entry per file whose plugin threw, as `{"plugin", "file", "message"}`,
  with the message capped and the full error left in the run log), and
  `changedFilesTypeDebt` (the suppression, any-alias, and `any` totals now
  present in the changed files, with the suppressed error codes; `null` if
  that scan failed).
- Four of those fields have confusable names and different consequences.
  `migratedFilesWithSyntaxErrors` and `pluginErrors` fail the run;
  `nonMigratedFilesWithSyntaxErrors` and `pluginFailures` do not. So a run can
  exit `0` with entries in the second pair, and a nonzero exit means entries in
  the first pair or a `filesToMigrate` of `0`.
- All three also report `skippedGitignoredFiles`, the number of files the
  run left untouched because git ignores them (0 with `--gitignore=false`),
  and `skippedBootstrapFiles`, the build system files kept as JavaScript
  as `{"file", "reason"}` pairs (empty with `--bootstrap=false`).

How to read a run from the outside:

- Exit `0` and the file exists: success; the summary is the source of truth
  for what changed. Check `pluginFailures`: a lint config that throws leaves
  files unchanged without failing the run, so a successful exit can still hide
  files no plugin could touch.
- Nonzero exit and the file exists: the run completed with errors; the file's
  `exitCode` field matches the process exit code. The last line the run printed
  names the counts (`Migration failed: 3 file(s) errored in plugins, 1 file(s)
  still have syntax errors.`), and the two arrays above name the files. A
  successful run prints no such line.
- Nonzero exit and no file: the command failed before running (bad flags,
  missing tsconfig.json), or the summary file itself could not be written.

The debt counts are scoped to this run's changed files; project-wide counts
come from `report --json`.

- `full`: one summary for the whole pipeline rather than one step's overwriting
  another's. `steps` lists all four in order as
  `{"name", "status", "exitCode", "commit"}`, where `status` is `ok`, `failed`,
  `skipped` (a step the run did not need, such as `init` on a folder that
  already has a tsconfig) or `not-reached` (a step an earlier failure stopped),
  and `commit` is the SHA that step's writes went into or `null` under
  `--commit=false`. `commits` lists the mechanical rewrite commits the run created
  as `{"sha", "subject"}`, in the order it made them. `rename` and `migrate`
  hold those steps' own summaries, in the exact shape documented above, or
  `null` where the step did not run.

## Exit codes and failure modes

- A `<folder>` that does not exist, or that is a file rather than a directory,
  exits `255` from every command that takes one and prints
  `<abs path> does not exist` or `<abs path> is not a directory`. The path is
  the one the argument resolved to, so a relative path that landed somewhere
  unexpected shows where. Nothing is read or written first.
- A name that is not a command exits `1` and prints `Unknown command: <name>`,
  or `Did you mean <command>?` when it is close to a real one. An argument past
  the ones a command declares is reported the same way, so
  `ts-migrate report <folder> extra` exits `1` naming `extra`. An option no
  command declares exits `1` the same way, printing `Unknown argument`, so a
  mistyped flag fails before the run rather than being silently ignored for the
  length of a migration. `ts-migrate full` forwards a single argument list to
  both `rename` and `migrate` and declares the union of what the two accept, so
  every flag either step takes is one it recognizes.
- `migrate`/`reignore`/`retype` exit `0` on success and nonzero (255) if a
  plugin errored or a file still has syntax errors after migration.
- `migrate` exits nonzero when it has nothing to migrate, and names the signal
  that produced the empty set: a tsconfig `include` that matched no file
  (reported as TS18003, and the usual cause is that `rename` has not run yet),
  a `--sources` glob that matched nothing, a tsconfig matching only declaration
  files or only JavaScript, or every candidate skipped as gitignored or as a
  build system file. The run prints the size of the migration set before the
  first plugin banner, so a scoped run that selected less than intended is
  visible from the first screen rather than from a diff that never appeared.
- `check` exits `1` when a per-file count exceeds the baseline; `report` and
  `check` exit nonzero (255) if the tsconfig cannot be read. `check` also exits
  255 when it has to write the baseline and cannot, which a `--baselineFile`
  under a directory that does not exist is the usual cause of. A run whose
  counts improved on a baseline it cannot rewrite still exits `0`: the ratchet
  held, and the baseline is left higher than the code.
- `init` exits 255 when it cannot write the tsconfig, and `rename` exits 255
  when it cannot move a file; a read-only checkout is the usual cause. The
  moves `rename` made before the failing one stand, and re-running it once the
  files can be written finishes the job: what already moved no longer has a
  JavaScript extension and drops out of the mapping. Both commands only warn
  for the files that are not the point of the step, and still exit `0`: `init`
  for the generated asset declarations, `rename` for the `package.json` and
  `project.json` references, which by then name files that have already moved.
- `migrate`, `reignore` and `retype` exit 255 when they cannot write a file they
  migrated. Every other file in the run is written first, and each failure is
  named with its reason, so a read-only file does not cost the rest of the run.
  The changes to a file that could not be written are lost; re-run once it is
  writable. Those files are left out of the updated files `--jsonSummary`
  lists, so a summary never names a change the file does not hold.
- `ts-migrate full` stops at the first failing step, naming it and exiting with
  that step's code, and prints the type definition recommendations it had
  gathered along with the file they stay in; the final `tsc` check
  failing means the migration did not reach a compiling state. Its failure
  message distinguishes the common causes: TS2578 (the check ran a different
  compiler than the migration, which is left only by a custom tsc path or a
  project compiler outside the supported range; align the two compilers first,
  because `reignore` under the skew re-derives the same suppressions, then
  `reignore`), TS1xxx syntax errors in
  generated/third-party `.d.ts` files (fix, regenerate, or exclude them —
  the migrate step lists these files up front; re-running the migration
  cannot change them), and ordinary type errors (`reignore`).
- "eslint-fix skipped / could not parse" warnings are expected until the
  project's ESLint understands TypeScript; the migration is still valid.
- "Error occurred in eslint-fix plugin" leaves that file unlinted but does not
  invalidate the migration. If the run line says the ESLint is bundled rather
  than the project's, the config is likely being run by an engine it was not
  written for; installing eslint in the project fixes the mismatch.
- `rename` exits nonzero if `<folder>` has no `tsconfig.json` — run `init`
  first (`ts-migrate full` does). A run that reports "No JS/JSX files to
  rename." succeeded but matched nothing: `<folder>` probably points at the
  wrong directory (e.g. a monorepo root instead of the package).

## Verifying a migration

1. `npx tsc -p <folder>/tsconfig.json --noEmit` exits 0.
2. No `.js`/`.jsx` sources remain except intentional ones: gitignored build
   output and the build system files the run kept, both named in the run
   logs and in `--jsonSummary`. A stray `.js` file outside those lists
   usually means the tsconfig selection missed it.
3. Suppression count is reasonable:
   `npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate report <folder>` prints the
   totals, the suppressed error codes, and the worst files. If most
   suppressed codes are TS2304/TS2582 (globals like `require` or
   `describe`), environment types are missing; install them and re-run
   `reignore` instead of editing files.
4. Optional, recommended on repos with CI:
   `npx -p @obiemunoz/ts-migrate ts-migrate check <folder>` writes a
   `.ts-migrate-baseline.json`; commit it and run `check` in CI so the
   build fails when suppression or `any` counts creep back up.
